# Python App to Monitor Mac's Battery Health

Apple states: 
> "Batteries have a limited amount of charge cycles before their performance is expected to diminish. Once the cycle count is reached, a replacement battery is recommended to maintain performance. You can use your battery after it reaches its maximum cycle count, but you might notice a reduction in your battery life."

## Introduction:

This python script constantly monitors the battery usage of your Macbook (every 10 minutes; can be customized based on your need). 

- notifies & dictates if significant energy is being used,

- notifies if charges are past 80% (charging till 100% reduces your mac's battery life over time, don't ever do that!)

- provides analysis on the number of lasting days for each battery capacity

- displays the current cycle count (Automation App)

- creates a log for future observations

## Closing thoughts

I've been using this script for years and it showed good results. Hereby, I wanted to share it with all the other Macbook users who are concerned about their battery health. Try it out and let me know your thoughts!
